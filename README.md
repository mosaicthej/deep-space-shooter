# deep-space-shooter

A game that <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/xaviercostermans/"> Xvaier Costermans</a> and me created using Python and Pygame library in 2018, third-year of high school. For a computer science class final project.

There is no thing in git workflow as we did not know git at that time. 

sorry for bad formatting and file structures


Looking to recreate this as android game / html5 web game, with multiplayer mode.


Loved Touhou and used many of their soundtracks, thank you Team Shanghai Alice, my forever idol!



peace.
